# Bamazon
Bamazon

Bamazon is a CLI style storefront using the npm inquirer package and the MySQL database backend with the npm mysql package. The application has two interfaces: customer and manager.

Make sure you have MySQL installed and a local server running. MySQL can be found at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

To run the app, first run npm install to install the required dependencies. 

Next, open each javascript file(bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js) in a code editor and add in your MySQL log-in information. 
The default username is set to root. This can be replaced with any username you might be using. The default password is blank. Following the comments in the JS file, replace the blank space with your server's password. 

Once you have configured the application for your setup, you can run the application via a command line. Follow the prompts to use the application.
